# SprintHealthDashboard Component Technical Specification

## Overview
SprintHealthDashboard is a React component built with shadcn/ui that provides comprehensive sprint analysis and health monitoring capabilities for Agile teams. The component implements all features specified in the SprintHealth hackathon task.

## Technical Stack
- React
- shadcn/ui
- TypeScript (recommended)
- Chart.js (for visualizations)

## Component Structure

### State Management
The component maintains the following state:
- data: Raw sprint and task data
- sprints: Array of available sprints
- teams: Array of available teams
- selectedSprints: Currently selected sprints
- selectedTeams: Currently selected teams
- timeFrame: Current timeline position
- metrics: Calculated sprint health metrics

### Core Features

1. File Upload
   - Accepts .txt and .csv files
   - Parses sprint, task, and history data
   - Updates component state with parsed data

2. Sprint Selection
   - Multiple sprint selection capability
   - Dynamic filtering based on selected sprints
   - Real-time metric updates on selection change

3. Team Selection
   - Multiple team selection support
   - Team-based metric filtering
   - Cross-team comparison capabilities

4. Timeline Control
   - Interactive slider for time period selection
   - Real-time metric updates based on selected timeframe
   - Visual timeline representation

5. Metric Visualization
   - Numeric displays for key metrics
   - Bar/line charts for trend visualization
   - Status-based color coding

## Metric Calculations

### Primary Metrics
1. To Do Tasks
   - Formula: SUM(estimation/3600)
   - Status Category: "Created"
   - Format: Number with one decimal place

2. In Progress Tasks
   - Formula: SUM(estimation/3600)
   - Status: Active tasks not in Done/Removed
   - Format: Number with one decimal place

3. Completed Tasks
   - Formula: SUM(estimation/3600)
   - Status Category: "Closed", "Done"
   - Format: Number with one decimal place

4. Removed Tasks
   - Formula: SUM(estimation/3600)
   - Status: Rejected/Cancelled/Duplicate
   - Format: Number with one decimal place

### Secondary Metrics
1. Backlog Changes
   - Percentage calculation of tasks added after sprint start
   - Warning thresholds: >20% yellow, >50% red
   - Format: Percentage with one decimal place

2. Blocked Tasks (Optional)
   - Tracks tasks with "Blocked" or "is blocked by" relationships
   - Format: Hours/Day

3. Added/Removed Tasks (Optional)
   - Daily tracking of task additions/removals
   - Format: Hours/Day and count

## UI Layout

### Header Section
- Component title
- File upload control
- Sprint/Team selection dropdowns

### Control Panel
- Timeline slider
- Metric calculation parameters
- View toggles

### Metrics Display
- Primary metrics grid
- Status distribution chart
- Timeline-based trend visualization

### Detail Section
- Detailed metric breakdowns
- Task status transitions
- Team-specific analytics

## Interaction Patterns

1. Data Loading
   - File upload triggers parsing
   - Loading indicator during processing
   - Error handling for invalid data

2. Selection Updates
   - Immediate metric recalculation on selection change
   - Multiple selection support
   - Clear selection option

3. Timeline Navigation
   - Smooth slider interaction
   - Date range display
   - Preset period options

4. Visualization Interaction
   - Chart tooltips
   - Click-through for details
   - Export capabilities

## Performance Considerations

1. Data Handling
   - Efficient parsing algorithms
   - Memoized calculations
   - Chunked processing for large datasets

2. Rendering Optimization
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Debounced updates
   - Lazy loading of visualizations

3. State Management
   - Optimized state updates
   - Cached calculations
   - Efficient re-render patterns

## Browser Support
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Yandex Browser

## Accessibility
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode support

## Error Handling
- Invalid file format detection
- Data parsing error recovery
- Graceful fallback displays
- User-friendly error messages

## Additional Features
- Data export functionality
- Customizable metric thresholds
- Team performance comparisons
- Sprint health scoring system
- Historical trend analysis

This component specification ensures full compliance with the hackathon requirements while providing a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly solution for sprint health analysis.
